Throughout my studies I‚Äôve found that user experience and user interaction design is filled with norms, rules and best practices - leaving the end result to be un-inspiring and boring.<br>In this in-depth case study, I wanted to delve into how designers might use play and playfulness as not only a process, but an end result or end-user effect. The outcome was a handbook explaining how creators might consider play and playfulness in their own designs.",

Driven by my inner motivation and unanswered questions, the handbook is just as much a manifesto for myself as a helpful tool for designers. Solutions are just the tip of the iceberg that is the process, and by exploring and challenging myself to look further in the field of design I might become a better designer.<br>... I hope ü•≥"
