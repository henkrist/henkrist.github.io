I was tasked with looking into personal finance for young parents.<br>The result was a concept IOT-device that makes tracking of family expences visible for all members of the family.",

The frame is connected to an application and uses the PSD2 API to gather abstracted and relative information about spendings within selected categories.",

During my studies in Trondheim, these end-users are often the ideal users in an ideal world, observe and tested on in micro-environments. <br>This project challenged me to look broader in the field of user motivations.",

        "text4":"The project was short, but I taught me to think beyond the audiable needs of users, and instead try to create something that was more a gadget and a nice object.<br>It was also a good exercise in physical product design, a branch of design I wish to be better at."
