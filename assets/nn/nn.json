        "text0":"During the spring of 2019 I was tasked with my hardest problem to date; making a game aimed at kids who suffer from school refusal. The game is rooted in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and is designed to be a catalyst for conversation around difficult topics.<br><br><a href='https://medium.com/tackl/verktÃ¸y-for-en-bedre-skolehverdag-30f1b7e96bbc' target='_blank'>Read more about the project in the Medium post</a> written by TACKL founder, Sindre Holme.",

        "caption2":"Cognetive Behavioral Therapy is a process where a person is exposed to a troublesome situation in controlled enviroments. In this case; if you are afraid of dogs but spend more and more time with them you can turn the 'bad' thought to a good thought.",

        "caption3":"As you play through the game, the board that started with only bad thoughts becomes captured and the thoughts become good.",

        "h2":"No right solution",
        "text1":"Being a designer means solving complex problems with simple solutions. This problem was entirely new for me. There is not nor ever will be one solution for this problem. The best I could do was make a tool for the child and the people around the child to use and hope it works. The main goal was to make a catalyst for conversation, and that goal was met."
